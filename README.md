# Snippets Website

This is a website I made in node.js in 2015. It allows a user to make an account and upload and tag code snippets to it. You can also search the tags for other code snippets to see what other people have added.

The accounts are password secured with bcrypt encryption, and everything is stored in a mongodb database.
